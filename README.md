# Keylogger
My take on an advanced Windowd keylogger written in Python. Keys as well as the system information are logged into a file that is emailed to a selected destination address. The original log file on the computer is then deleted and the recycle bin is cleared. Inspired by the tutorial by Grant Collins.
